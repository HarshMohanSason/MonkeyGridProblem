Dear Harsh,

Thank you for expressing your interest in Resilio. Before we proceed to schedule an interview, we would appreciate it if you could showcase your qualifications through a simple C++ code implementation.

We would like to see your approach to solve the problem, as well as a code you'll write, You can use newer versions of C++ or STL. We don't recommend using ChatGPT or similar sites, since I saw a lot of such code :)

Please select one task and spend no more than 2 hours on it:


Task 1. There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. That is, from (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).

Points where the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the y coordinate are lesser than or equal to 19 are accessible to the monkey. For example, the point (59, 79) is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater than 19. Another example: the point (-5, -7) is accessible because abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 19.

How many points can the monkey access if it starts at (0, 0), including (0, 0) itself?

Input sample:

There is no input for this program.

Output sample:

Print the number of points the monkey can access. It should be printed as an integer â€” for example, if the number of points is 10, print "10", not "10.0" or "10.00", et
